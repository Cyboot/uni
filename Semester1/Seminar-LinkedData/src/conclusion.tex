\section{Conclusions}
The algorithms and methods summarized in this report by Lehmann et
al\cite{paper1} and Bühmann et al\cite{paper2} show promising results. 
The authors of \cite{paper1} 
analysed their CELOE algorithm with different heuristics and
proved that approximating heuristic values are often very accurate while
improving the performance significantly. The strong bias towards shorter
expressions increase the readability of suggestions and help the knowledge
engineer to verify additional statements. 

The enrichment methods in \cite{paper2} took a different approach on the schema
enrichment. They took different types of OWL axiom to improve the semantic
structure of existing ontologies. The evaluation of this approach showed
that the method also works on very large scales, like the size of the DBpedia knowledge base.
