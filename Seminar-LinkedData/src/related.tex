\section{Related Work}
Related work can be divided into two categories: the first part covers
supervised machine learning with OWL, the second part is focused on
(semi-)automated ontology engineering methods.
\\
Early work of supervised learning in description logic was published in
\cite{related_9,related_10}, which uses the so called \emph{least common
subsumer} to solve the learning problem. Later work invented the concept of the
refinement operator to solve the problem in a top-down
approach.\cite{related_7} The refinement operator was later adapted for
description logic \cite{refinement1,refinement2,refinement3} and is used as described in
CELOE.
\\
The starting point of (semi-)automatic ontology engineering was set by
\cite{related_31}, a formal concept analysis was descibed in \cite{related_5}.
Another interesting approach is presented in \cite{related_relexo} which
proposes to improve knowlege bases through relation exploration. It is
implemented in the RELExO framework.
