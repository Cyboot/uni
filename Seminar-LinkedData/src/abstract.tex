The Semantic Web is steadily growing and the availability of large knowledge
graphs increased over the past years. In spite of the growing number of
knowledge bases, there exist very few with a sophisticated schema. Often they only consist of a
collection of facts with no consistent structure. Other knowledge bases contain
only schema information without instances.
\\
But only the combination of both, sophisticated schema and
available instance data can enable powerful reasoning, easier consistency
checking and improved query abilities.
\\
This report summarizes the content of two papers: (1) ``Class expression
learning for ontology engineering'' by Lehmann et al and (2) ``Universal
OWL Axiom Enrichment for Large Knowledge Bases'' by Bühmann et al.
The method of the first paper focuses at finding and creating class
expressions in an automatic or semiautomatic approach based on given knowledge in
the graph.
Whereas the methods of the second paper talks about enrichment of knowledge
bases with different types of OWL2 axioms.
