The Semantic Web is still growing and the availability of large knowledge graphs
increased over the past years. In spite of the growing number of knowlege bases
there exist very few with a sophisticated schema. Often they only consist of a
collection of facts with no consistant structure. Other knowlege bases contain
only schema information without instances of the defined schemata.
\\
But only the combination of both of these extremes, sophisticated schema and
available instance data can enable powerful reasoning, easier checking for
consistency and improved queryability. 
\\
This report summarizes the content of two papers: (1) ``Class expression
learning for ontology engineering'' by Lehmann et al and (2) ``Universal
OWL Axiom Enrichment for Large Knowledge Bases'' by Bühmann et al.
The method of the first article focuses at finding and creating class
expressions in an automatic or semiautomatic approach based on given knowlege in
the graph.
Whereas the methods of the second paper enrichs knowlege bases with different
types of OWL2 axioms.
