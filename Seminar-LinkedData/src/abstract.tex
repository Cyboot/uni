The Semantic Web is steadily growing and the availability of large knowledge
graphs increased over the past years. In spite of the growing number of
knowledge bases, there exist very few with a sophisticated schema. Often they only consist of a
collection of facts with no consistent structure. Other knowledge bases contain
only schema information without instances.
\\
But only the combination of both, sophisticated schema and
available instance data can enable powerful reasoning, easier consistency
checking and improved query abilities.
\\
This article shows two methods for the semantic enrichment of large OWL
knowledge bases. The first method focuses at finding and creating class expressions
in an automatic or semiautomatic approach, based on the existing data in the
graph.
Whereas the second method enriches knowledge bases with different types of OWL2
axioms.
