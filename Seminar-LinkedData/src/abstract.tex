The Semantic Web is still growing and the availability of large knowledge graphs
increased over the past years. In spite of the growing number of knowlege bases
there exist very few with a sophisticated schema. Often they only consist of a
collection of facts with no consistant structure. Other knowlege bases contain
only schema information without instances of the defined schemata.
\\
But only the combination of both of these extremes, sophisticated schema and
available instance data can enable powerful reasoning, easier checking for
consistency and improved queryability. 
\\
This article show two methods for the semantic enrichment of large OWL knowlege
bases. The first method focuses at finding and creating class expressions
in an automatic or semiautomatic approach based on given knowlege in the graph. 
Whereas the second method enrichs knowlege bases with different types of OWL2
axioms.
