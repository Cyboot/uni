\section{Conclusions}
The algorithms and methods summarized in this article like they were presented
in \cite{paper1} and \cite{paper2} show promising results. The authors of
\cite{paper1} analysed their CELOE algorithm with different heuristics and
proved that approximating heuristic values are often very accurate while
improving the performance significantly. The strong bias towards shorter
expressions increase the readability of suggestions and help the knowlege
engineer to verify additional statements. 

The enrichment methods in \cite{paper2} also show great potential. The
evaluation of this approached showed that the method also works on very large
scales, like the size of the DBpedia knowlege base. In future works the authors
will investigate enhancements in the presented methods and collaborate with the
authors of \cite{31} to further fine-tune the approach.
