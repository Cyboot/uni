While the availability and size of knowlege bases has grown dramaticly in the
last few years, there is still often a signifacantly lack of sophisticated
schema.
Enrichment of schema information based on already existing data is the main
content of this article.
To illustrate the benefits of of a sophisticated schema together with reliable
instance data consider the following example.

\begin{example}
Imagine a knowlege base containing famous persons like Barack Obama, Mahatma
Gandhi, Elvis Presley etc. and a property called \texttt{birthPlace}. An
algorithm may find out that every of these person contains this property and
therefore the \texttt{birthPlace} can be a functional property with the domain
\texttt{Person}.
\vspace{-0.55 cm}
\begin{verbatim}
OBjectProperty: birthPlace
  Domain: Person
  Range: Place
  SubPropertyOf: hasBeenAt
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}
\vspace{-0.4 cm}

Adding such axiom to the knowlege base can have several benefits\cite{paper2}:
(1) Axioms can servere as documentation for the right usage of the schema, (2) adding
additional schema can improve consistency and help to debug missing or incorrect
information, (3) additional (implicit) information can be inferred, in our
example every person also \texttt{hasBeenAt} their \texttt{birthPlace}.
Adding new axioms and finding/fixing missing information can be done in an
semi-automated approach. A knowlege engineer can then decide if new axioms are
fitting and existing data must be adjusted.

In summary, the combination of a good schema with large instance data allows for
powerful reasoning, improved query ability and simplified consistency checking.
